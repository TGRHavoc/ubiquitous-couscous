# Installation

## Prerequisites

In order to have this working, it is advised that you already have a webserver running and correctly configured.

You will also need to install [live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map) on your FiveM server and have it configured.


## How to install

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map-interface/archive/master.zip).

This should be enough to get the interface up and running on your website. If you want to change stuff like the images, look in the [configuration]({{< ref "configure.md" >}}) section.
